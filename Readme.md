## Introduction
The term ATM stands for automated teller machine. It is an electronic device that is used by only bank customers to process account transactions. The users access their accounts through a special type of plastic card that is encoded with user information on a magnetic strip. The strip contains an identification code that is transmitted to the bankâ€™s central computer by modem. The users insert the card into ATMs to access the account and process their account transactions.
