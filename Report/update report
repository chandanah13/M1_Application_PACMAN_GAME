Pacman Game in C is a simple console application or a mini clip game designed for the purpose of entertainment. It resembles the snake game to some extent in which the Pacman should be driven in such a way that it moves along the predefined blue path so that the path is erased or eaten by Pacman. More you erase the path, more score you gain; the game is easy to play. Here, I have presented the source code and output screens for this project.

1.The user defined header file created in the source code of the game is header.h. The C files of the game are for controlling the motion & direction of Pacman as well as to create the path.

2.Pacman Game in C gives the clear concept of use of file handling, the use of user defined header files, combination of number of C files in a single project etc.

3.The Pacman Game in C is so simple to stat, play and terminate. In order to play the game, you should just click on the application file (.exe file) of the game.

4.you will see the game window in which you will have to drive the Pacman along the thick blue lines in rectangular format.

5.The direction of Pacman is controlled with the navigation keys (up, down, left and right keys) of the key board. Space bar pauses the movement of Pacman.

6.If you are able to drive the Pacman along all the lines so that Pacman eats all, you will be winner.

Low level requirements:
| ID |  Description |  Status (Implemented/Future)|
|:--:|:------------:|:---------------------------:|
| 1  |Using Scratch to develop computer objects  that will interact with each other in the game | Implemented |
| 2  | We will only develop five sprites with scripts for this program  but will be using copies of the sprites to make a complete fully interactive video game | Implemented |
| 3 |. Our last sprite will be called GameOver and will display a game over message on screen once thrPac-Man characters have been eaten by the ghosts and the game is finished|       Implemented |
| 4 | Exit is an module which describes the exit of the system or current process| Implemenedt |

| 4 | Animationcode (blocks) will be kept separate from functionality code (blocks) sothat sprites can be reused with simple changes to the costumes andminor changes to  some variables. | Future |
