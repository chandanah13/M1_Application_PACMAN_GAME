INTRODUCTION

Pacman Game in C is a simple console application or a mini clip game designed for the purpose of entertainment. It resembles the snake game to some extent in which the Pacman should be driven in such a way that it moves along the predefined blue path so that the path is erased or eaten by Pacman. More you erase the path, more score you gain; the game is easy to play. Here, I have presented the source code and output screens for this project.
